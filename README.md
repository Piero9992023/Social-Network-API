  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to make a possible social media alternative in the works for a new a group of users that are bored of the mainstream social media platforms and seek a new, fresh experience. The motivation behind creating this social network api was to showcase my newly learned mongoose (npm package) and mongoDB skills and to challenge myself in building a functional and useful product. The project unequivocally achieved this goal. This social api network shows how a mongoose can be able to add users through the mongoose database by adding their username and email, can be able to update, delete, search for a single user or all users. Mongoose can also allow for users to add different user as their friend and their friend will be able to go up. This social network also shows hoe mongoose allows for user to create thoughts in the database. User thoughts can be updated, deleted, and be searched all at once or can be search for a single thought. Reactions can also be added or deleted to a user's thought. One problem that my social network api solves is how easier it is to use a mongoose database to structure and organize each user, friend, thought and reaction opposed to MYSQL. I have learned the various, different methods there are in mongoose for example `$addToSet, $push, $pull. and $set`. These methods are crucial to learn when creating a controlllers with mongoose. 

  ## Installation
  The first step was to install the package.json. The packages that were required to complete this assignment was the express and mongoose npm packages. The next step was to require those packages in the models, controllers, server.js , and routes that the packages can be able to function. After the coding was completed the last step was to start the server by doing "node server.js in the terminal". The technologies that were used to build this project besides the npm packages, were Javascript, node.js, and insomnia.
